# Joint Savings Smart Contract

This repo contains a Solidity smart contract that implements a joint savings account.

The smart contract allows for creation of an account that uses two user addresses.  The smart contract uses ether management functions to provide the features of the joint savings account. These features include getting information about the account, as well as the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
